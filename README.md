## 🔧 Multi-Task Learning (MTL)

We train the model to predict both age and gender **simultaneously**, using the following loss functions:

| Task     | Output Type         | Loss Function           |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Age      | Regression           | `MSELoss` (Mean Squared Error) |
| Gender   | Binary Classification| `BCEWithLogitsLoss`     |

## ⚠️ Challenge: Loss Scale Imbalance

The **age loss** (MSE) often has a larger magnitude than the **gender loss** (BCE), which can make training unstable.

### ✅ Solution: Learnable Uncertainty Weighting

We apply the technique from:
> 📄 *"[Multi-Task Learning Using Uncertainty to Weigh Losses for Scene Geometry and Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07115)"* (Kendall et al.)

### 💡 Idea:
The model learns task-specific uncertainty parameters ($\sigma^2$) that automatically scale each loss:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}=\frac{1}{2\sigma_1^2}\mathcal{L}_{\text{age}}&plus;\log\sigma_1&plus;\frac{1}{2\sigma_2^2}\mathcal{L}_{\text{gender}}&plus;\log\sigma_2" title="Multi-task loss formula"/>
</div>

Where:
- L_age = Age regression loss (MSE)
- L_gender = Gender classification loss (BCE)
- σ₁, σ₂ = Learned uncertainties (as log-variance)

This allows the model to **dynamically balance** the contributions of each task based on its uncertainty during training.
